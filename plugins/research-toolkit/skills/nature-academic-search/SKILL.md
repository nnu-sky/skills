# Academic Search — Router

Choose the workflow from the requested outcome, not isolated words such as
"查论文" or "整理成表格". Keep the source set and verification scope proportional
to that outcome; do not expand an ordinary lookup into a literature audit.

This skill is split into two layers:

- A **static layer** under `static/` that holds versioned, reusable content fragments (the MCP tool inventory and shared modules, and source routing plus operational rules).
- A **dynamic layer** (this file plus `manifest.yaml`) that detects which workflow the user needs and loads that workflow, reaching for shared modules and scripts only when a step needs them.

Load the relevant core and selected fragments on first use. Reuse already loaded guidance in the same task; reread only changed or missing sections.

## Routing protocol

Follow these five steps every time the skill is invoked.

### 1. Load the manifest and the core layer

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). It declares the `workflow` axis, the allowed values, and the file paths each value maps to.

Also read every file listed under `always_load`:

- `static/core/tools.md` — the MCP tool inventory (core search, extended search, PubMed utilities) and the shared-module map.
- `static/core/routing-and-ops.md` — the T1→T2→T3 source routing quick guide, environment setup, error handling, and limitations.

### 2. Detect the workflow

Map the user's need to one or more `workflow` values:

- `multi-source-search` — find literature across sources.
- `citation-verification` — verify citations extracted from a document.
- `mesh-strategy` — build a MeSH/PubMed search strategy.
- `citation-file-mgmt` — convert/manage `.nbib`/`.ris`/`.bib` files.
- `reference-mgmt` — BibTeX, related-article discovery, ID conversion.
- `strict-other-citation-impact-audit` — determine strict independent other-citations, build article-level citation metric tables, identify high-profile citers (academy members, presidents/deans, talent-award holders, fellows, field leaders), and extract how they cited the target paper.

A combined request (for example search then export) may need more than one. State the detected workflow(s) in one short line before proceeding.

### 3. Load the matching workflow fragment(s)

Read the file mapped for each detected workflow (under `references/workflows/`). Do **not** read every workflow. Each workflow file links to the shared modules it needs.

### 4. Run the workflow using the loaded material

Apply the loaded material in this order:

1. Core tools and routing (`core/tools.md`, `core/routing-and-ops.md`) — which MCP tool for which need, and the T1→T2→T3 fallback chain that is the standard execution order across all workflows.
2. The workflow fragment — its specific steps.
3. Shared modules and scripts on demand (dedup, citation parser, search strategy, RIS/BibTeX format, format converter).

Report specific tool failures and continue with remaining tools; broaden terms when there are no results; fall back to manual generation from MCP-fetched metadata if a script fails twice.

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

The files under `references/` (and `scripts/`) are deep references, not defaults. Open them on demand per the `references.on_demand` table in the manifest — for example `references/source-tiers.md` for the full reliability classification, `references/dedup-engine.md` / `references/citation-parser.md` / `references/search-strategy.md` / `references/ris-bibtex-format.md` for the shared modules, and `scripts/academic_search.py` (no-MCP fallback discovery search) / `scripts/format-converter.py` / `scripts/preflight.py` for the tooling.

## Why this split

- The static layer is versioned and reviewable; the workflow files and shared modules were already factored this way.
- The dynamic layer keeps each invocation cheap: only the workflow the user needs enters context, instead of all six plus every module.
- The router itself is short on purpose. Update fragments and references, not this file, when adding scope.
- This structure mirrors the other nature-* skills (`nature-writing`, `nature-polishing`, `nature-reader`, `nature-paper2ppt`, `nature-figure`, `nature-citation`, `nature-response`, `nature-data`).

## Resource paths

Resolve scripts and references relative to the loaded SKILL.md directory, not the task working directory. Write generated outputs to the user or project output directory, not into the installed skill.
